# lane detection

Lane detection is a developing technology that is implemented in vehicles to enable autonomous navigation. Most 
lane detection systems are designed for roads with proper structure relying on the existence of markings. The main 
shortcoming of these approaches is that they might give inaccurate results or not work at all in situations involving 
unclear markings or the absence of them. In this study one such approach for detecting lanes on an unmarked road 
is reviewed followed by an improved approach. Both the approaches are based on digital image processing 
techniques and purely work on vision or camera data. The main aim is to obtain a real time curve value to assist the 
driver/autonomous vehicle for taking required turns and not go off the road.

This project is created to demonstrate how a lane detection system works on cars equipped with a front-facing camera. 
Finding a place in more and more vehicles, this system is an essential part of the advanced driver assistance systems 
(ADAS) used in autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicles. This feature is responsible for detecting lanes, measuring curve 
radius, and monitoring the offset from the center. With this information, the system significantly improves safety by 
making sure the vehicle is centered inside the lane lines, as well as adds comfort if it is also configured to control the 
steering wheel to take gentle curves on highways without any driver input. This is a simplified version of what is used in 
production vehicles, and the best functions if good conditions are provided (clear lane lines, stable light conditions). In 
this repository, it is included a dash cam footage for the script to work.
